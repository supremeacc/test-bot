### 🔧 Instruction for Replit AI

You are an expert full-stack Discord bot developer.
I want you to build a **Discord Intro Manager Bot** for my community server **AI Learners India**.
This bot should automatically validate and format introductions posted by new members in a specific channel.
I don’t have coding knowledge, so please make it **fully no-code friendly**, with **clear setup steps**.

---

### ⚙️ Features Required

#### 🧭 1. Channel Logic

* The bot listens to messages in a channel called `#introductions`.
* It posts formatted, verified intros to another channel called `#profiles`.

---

#### 🧠 2. Intro Format Rules

Users must follow this format:

```
  Name:   
  Role / Study:   
  Institution / Organization:   
  Interests (AI Fields or Tools):   
  Skills (Programming, Platforms, etc.):   
  Experience Level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced):   
  Goal or What You Want to Build:   
  Portfolio / GitHub / LinkedIn (optional): 
```

---

#### ✅ 3. If Format is Correct

* Extract all 7 fields from the message.
* Generate a **Discord Embed** with:

  * Title: “Member Introduction”
  * Fields for each section (Name, Role, Interests, Skills, Experience Level , Goal, Portfolio)
  * Footer: “👤 Added by @username”
  * Embed color: soft random color
* Post this embed in `#profiles`.

---

#### ⚠️ 4. If Format is Incomplete or Wrong

* Identify missing fields.
* Reply to the user in `#introductions` with this message:

```
⚠️ Your introduction seems incomplete.
Missing fields: [list missing fields]

Please resend your intro in this format:

🎓 Name:  
💼 Role / Study:  
🤖 Interests:  
🧠 Skills:  
🚀 Goal:  
```

---

#### 🔁 5. If User Updates Intro

* If the same user sends a new intro, delete their old one in `#profiles` and replace it with the new one.

---

### 🧰 Technical Requirements

* Use **Node.js** and **discord.js v14+**
* Load configuration from `.env` file:

  * `DISCORD_TOKEN`
  * `INTRO_CHANNEL_ID`
  * `PROFILE_CHANNEL_ID`
  * `CLIENT_ID`
  * `GUILD_ID`
* Use async/await
* Include clear comments for each section
* No unnecessary complexity
* Log all important actions to the console for debugging
