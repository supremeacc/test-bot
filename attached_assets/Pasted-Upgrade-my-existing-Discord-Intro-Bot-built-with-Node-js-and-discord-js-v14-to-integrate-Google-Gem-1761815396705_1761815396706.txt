Upgrade my existing Discord Intro Bot built with Node.js and discord.js v14+ to integrate Google Gemini Free API and add smart intro analysis + visual enhancements.

🧩 FEATURES TO ADD
1. 🤖 Gemini Integration

Use the free Google Gemini API (generative language API).

When a new intro is detected in the #introductions channel:

Send the intro text to Gemini with this analysis prompt:

Analyze this user introduction for clarity, skill level, and tone.
Then refine it into a short, clean version for a Discord profile embed.
Based on the content, assign a suitable “Role” title (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert, AI Researcher, Automation Builder, etc.).
Respond in structured JSON:
{
  "refined_intro": "short refined text",
  "role": "assigned role",
  "experience_level": "beginner/intermediate/expert",
  "color": "hex or RGB color suggestion"
}


Parse the JSON response and use it to build the embed.

2. 🎨 Dynamic Embed Creation

Create a rich Discord embed with the following structure:

Title: "🎓 Member Introduction"

Description: refined intro from Gemini

Fields:

Role: (from Gemini)

Skills: (from the original message)

Goal: (from refined intro or original)

Footer: “👤 Added by @username”

Thumbnail: use the user’s profile picture (message.author.displayAvatarURL())

Color:

If experience_level = beginner → light green

intermediate → orange

expert → red

else → blue

3. 🧩 Smart Role & Color Logic

The color must be influenced by Gemini’s analysis:

More skills → red tone

Fewer → lighter tone

You can fallback to default values if Gemini doesn’t provide color.

4. ✍️ Command: /updateintro

Create a slash command /updateintro that allows users to:

Repost or edit their intro

Trigger re-analysis through Gemini

Update their embed in the #profiles channel automatically

5. 🧠 Error Handling

If Gemini API fails or rate limits occur:

Use fallback (original validation logic)

Post a simpler embed (gray color)

Notify user politely that AI analysis failed temporarily

6. ⚙️ Tech Details

Use:

discord.js v14+

dotenv

node-fetch or axios

Add .env variable:

DISCORD_TOKEN=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
INTRO_CHANNEL_ID=
PROFILE_CHANNEL_ID=


Use async/await for all operations.

Log all AI calls and responses in console for debugging.
