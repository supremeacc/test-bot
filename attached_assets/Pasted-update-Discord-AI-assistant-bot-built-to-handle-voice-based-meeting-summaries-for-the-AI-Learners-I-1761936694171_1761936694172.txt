update Discord AI assistant bot built to handle voice-based meeting summaries for the “AI Learners India” server. 

🧩 Core Functions:
1. When a user runs `/summarize-vc`, the bot should:
   - Join the user’s current voice channel (VC).
   - Start listening and recording all conversations using `@discordjs/voice` and `prism-media`.
   - Auto-retry joining if connection fails (max 3 retries, 2 seconds apart).
   - Show “🎙️ Listening to your VC discussion…” message in the text channel.

2. After the meeting ends or when `/stop-summary` is triggered:
   - Disconnect safely (avoid “failed to connect” or stuck connection states).
   - Convert the audio to text using the **Google Speech-to-Text API** or **Whisper API**.
   - Analyze the transcript using **Gemini Free API** with this logic:
     - Detect if the conversation is in English, Hindi, or Hinglish.
     - Generate a clean **Minutes of Meeting (MoM)** summary in the same tone/language.
     - Add bullet points for each major topic discussed.
     - Mention key action items and people if detected.
     - Keep summary under 10 lines, concise and readable.

3. Post the MoM in the same channel as an **Embed Message**:
   - Title: “🧠 Meeting Summary (Auto-generated by AI Learners Bot)”
   - Include the detected language (English / Hinglish / Hindi).
   - Color: 
       - 🟢 Green → if discussion was productive (keywords like “plan”, “launch”, “finished”).
       - 🟠 Orange → if it was brainstorming (keywords like “idea”, “discuss”, “maybe”).
       - 🔴 Red → if it involved blockers or confusion (keywords like “issue”, “problem”, “stuck”).
   - Include a timestamp, VC name, and list of participants (fetched from VC users).

4. Add a **slash command setting** `/summary-mode`:
   - Options: `english`, `hinglish`, `hindi`, `auto`
   - Default: `auto`
   - The bot respects this setting for all summaries.

5. Add automatic **error handling**:
   - If connection fails, try reconnecting up to 3 times.
   - If still failed, reply: “⚠️ Couldn’t connect to the VC. Please ensure I have permissions.”
   - If transcription or Gemini API fails, reply: “🛠️ Something went wrong while summarizing. Please retry.”

6. For Hinglish understanding:
   - Ensure the AI can handle mixed language like:
     “Guys kal tak model deploy karna hai aur report bhejni hai.”
   - Output in same language style:
     “Team ne kal tak model deploy karne aur report bhejne ka plan banaya.”

7. (Optional) Add a `/download-mom` command:
   - Converts the MoM into a downloadable PDF and sends it in DM.

8. Ensure the bot disconnects cleanly from the VC after summarizing or when idle for 2 minutes.
