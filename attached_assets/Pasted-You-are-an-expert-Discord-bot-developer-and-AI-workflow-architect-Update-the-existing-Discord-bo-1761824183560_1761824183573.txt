You are an expert Discord bot developer and AI workflow architect.

Update the existing Discord bot code with the following logic:

Goal:
Make the bot accept user introductions even if they are not in the exact provided format.
The bot should analyze, correct, and refine the input using the Gemini Free API, then automatically generate a clean embed post with role assignment.

---

🧩 Functionality to Implement:

1. **AI Analysis and Formatting**
   - When a user sends an intro message in the `#introductions` channel:
     - The bot sends the message to the Gemini Free API.
     - The AI analyzes the text semantically (not word-for-word) and converts it into a clean, structured intro format with fields:
       - Name
       - Role / Study
       - Institution / Organization
       - Interests
       - Skills
       - Experience Level
       - Goal
       - Portfolio / GitHub / LinkedIn (if any)

   - Even if users don’t use the exact format (e.g., "Hi I'm Riya, I study at NIT Trichy and love AI"), the AI should extract correct values and format them properly.

2. **Role Assignment**
   - Based on the “Experience Level” and “Skills,” assign roles dynamically:
     - Beginner → 🟢 Learner
     - Intermediate → 🟡 Builder
     - Advanced → 🔴 Expert

3. **Embed Creation**
   - After AI processing, create a refined embed post in the `#profiles` channel:
     - Include user’s refined intro data.
     - Add their Discord username & profile picture as thumbnail.
     - Tag the user in the embed.
     - Embed color logic:
       - More skills & experience = Red (#FF0000)
       - Intermediate = Yellow (#FFD700)
       - Beginner = Green (#00FF7F)

4. **Update Command**
   - Add a slash command `/update_intro` that allows users to update their introduction.
   - When triggered, the bot asks for new info → re-analyzes with Gemini → updates their profile embed and roles accordingly.

---

5. **Error Handling**
   - If the intro is too short or incomplete, the bot replies privately:
     “⚠️ Hey {username}, your intro seems incomplete! Please include your role, skills, and goals for better analysis.”
   - If the message isn’t related to introductions (off-topic), the bot ignores it silently.

---

6. **Technical Setup**
   - Use Discord.js v14
   - Use the Gemini Free API for AI analysis and formatting
   - Ensure that all API keys (Discord & Gemini) are stored securely in environment variables
   - Handle all API requests asynchronously with proper error handling
   - Post processed embed automatically in the channel `#profiles`
