Update the teammate-finder command so that the bot TAGS users instead of showing plain names.

🔹 Current Behavior:
The bot analyzes all user introductions using Gemini AI and returns teammate matches by name only (e.g., "Alies Ray").
We need to upgrade it so that:
1. The bot automatically tags those users using their Discord user ID (<@user_id>).
2. It keeps the AI-generated description and compatibility score.
3. It color-codes each match according to compatibility.

🔹 Updated Requirements:

Each user introduction stored in memory or database should include:
{
  id: "DiscordUserID",
  username: "DiscordUsername",
  skills: [],
  interests: [],
  summary: "AI-generated short intro"
}

When Gemini API returns top matches in JSON (e.g.):
[
  { "username": "Alies Ray", "reason_for_match": "...", "compatibility_score": 9 }
]

The bot should:
1. Search the stored intros for a matching username (case-insensitive).
2. Replace that username with `<@DiscordUserID>` mention.
3. Build a Discord embed with:
   - Title: 🤝 Best Teammate Matches for "{query}"
   - Description: AI Learners Bot analyzed {n} profiles and found your top teammate matches!
   - For each match:
        🧑 <@user_id>  
        💬 {reason_for_match}  
        💯 Compatibility: {score}/10
   - Color logic:
        🟢 ≥ 8
        🟡 5–7
        🔴 < 5
   - Footer: “Verified by AI Learners Bot • {timestamp}”
   - Thumbnail: requesting user’s profile picture

---

- Prompt Gemini:
  “Analyze the following introductions and return top 3 best teammate matches for someone looking for {query}.
   Each result must be a valid JSON array with: username, reason_for_match, compatibility_score.
   Do not include text outside JSON.”



Expected Output Example:
🤝 Best Teammate Matches for "who can help me to build AI projects"
AI Learners Bot analyzed 8 profiles and found your top teammate matches!

Deliverable:
Generate the full, ready-to-paste code for this feature in Node.js (Discord.js + Gemini API) so it works directly in Replit.
