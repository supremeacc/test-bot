You are an expert Discord bot developer.

Task:
Upgrade my Discord bot for AI Learners India with a modern setup and introduction flow.

🎯 Key Features to Implement:

1. **Setup Wizard (for Mods/Admins)**
   - Command: `/setup-bot`
   - Shows interactive dropdowns for selecting:
     - Intro Channel
     - Profile Channel
     - Moderator Role
     - Verification Channel
   - Save these IDs automatically in a JSON file or Replit DB.
   - Include `/setup-reset` to clear configuration.

2. **Introduction Button & Form System**
   - In the Intro Channel, bot posts a message:
     > “🎓 Welcome to AI Learners India! Click below to introduce yourself!”
     - Add button: [🪪 Introduce Yourself]
   - When clicked → open Discord modal with fields:
     - Name
     - Role / Study
     - Institution / Organization
     - Interests (AI Fields or Tools)
     - Skills
     - Experience Level (Dropdown: Beginner / Builder / Pro)
     - Goal
     - Portfolio / Links
   - On submit:
     - Send form data to Gemini API to refine and format it naturally in Hinglish.
     - AI decides appropriate embed color:
       🟢 Beginner, 🟡 Builder, 🔴 Pro.
     - AI assigns pre-existing role (developer, designer, automation, etc.).
     - Post refined profile embed in the selected Profile Channel.
     - Tag user and display their avatar in the embed.

3. **Role Detection**
   - Based on the AI analysis, automatically assign one matching pre-existing role.
   - Do NOT create new roles — only assign from existing ones.

4. **Update & Edit System**
   - Command: `/edit-profile`
   - Opens the same modal form pre-filled with previous info (if saved).
   - Replaces old embed in Profile Channel with updated version.

5. **Data Storage**
   - Store all intro data in Replit DB or a JSON file with:
     {
       "userId": "12345",
       "name": "...",
       "skills": "...",
       "roleAssigned": "Developer",
       "profileMessageId": "..."
     }

6. **Hinglish + English AI Understanding**
   - Allow Hinglish input (mix of Hindi + English).
   - Gemini API should detect language automatically and reply in natural Hinglish-English mix.
   - Example prompt for AI:
     "Refine the following introduction in Hinglish, keeping it professional but friendly."

7. **Error Handling**
   - If API fails or form incomplete, send an ephemeral message:
     “⚠️ Something went wrong. Please try again or contact a moderator.”

💡 Optional Enhancements:
   - Add badges (🧠, ⚙️, 🪄) in the embed footer based on skill detection.
   - Add “Find Similar Learners” button below profile that triggers teammate matching feature.

Libraries:
- discord.js v14
- discord-modals
- replit-db
- node-fetch
- google-generative-ai (for Gemini)

Ensure:
- Works with slash commands + buttons + modals.
- Can run fully on Replit free plan.
- Includes clear comments for easy customization.
