You are an expert Discord bot developer specializing in advanced community automation and collaboration systems.
Build a “Team Launch System” feature for my existing Discord bot in Node.js using discord.js v14.
The goal is to let members of my server (AI Learners India) apply for a private project space where they can collaborate on startups, AI projects, or study teams.

🧩 Core Features

Application Trigger (Apply Button)

The bot should send an embed message in a specific channel (e.g., #project-apply) that says:

🚀 Start Your Own AI Project Space!
Tap the “Apply” button below to create a private space for your startup, project, or study group.

Include a green Apply button.

When a user clicks the button → start an application process via a private thread or temporary private channel.

Application Form (Modal Input)

Show a modal form that collects:

🏷️ Project Name

💡 Short Description

🎯 Project Type (Startup / AI Research / Automation / Study Group / Other)

👥 Initial Teammates (optional mentions)

Verification Process

Once a user submits the form:

The bot creates a temporary private verification channel visible only to:

The applicant

The moderators (role ID to be specified later)

The bot itself

Post an embed summary of their responses.

Include two buttons: ✅ “Approve” and ❌ “Reject”.

If approved → proceed to channel creation.

If rejected → delete the temporary channel and notify the applicant via DM.

Private Channel Creation

On approval:

The bot automatically creates a new category named:

🚀｜Project - <ProjectName>

Inside it, create two channels:

#team-chat

🎙️ team-vc

Give access only to:

The applicant

Mentioned teammates (if any)

Moderator roles

Send a welcome embed in #team-chat:

🎉 Welcome to your private project space!
Use /add-teammate to invite collaborators.
Stay active and share your progress!

Teammate Management Command

Command: /add-teammate

Input: mention a user or multiple users.

Bot updates the channel permissions to allow access.

Send confirmation message tagging added users.

Auto-Cleanup or Archive

If the project’s channels are inactive for 15+ days → the bot should send a DM or message:

“Your project space seems inactive. Would you like to archive or keep it active?”

If no response after 3 days → move the category to an Archived Projects category.

Aesthetic and Style

All embeds must have vibrant colors depending on project type:

🧠 AI Research → Blue

⚙️ Automation → Orange

💼 Startup → Purple

🎓 Study Group → Green

Default → Gray

Embed footer: Verified by AI Learners India Bot 🤖

Optional Add-ons (if possible)

Add a “Showcase” channel where approved projects are listed publicly with summaries.

Bot should auto-post:

🧩 New Project Launched!
“<ProjectName>” by <@creator>
Type: <Type> | Team: <@teammates>

⚙️ Technical Notes

Use discord.js v14.

Keep token and guild ID as environment variables.

The code should be deployable on Replit and later hosted on Hostinger Node.js.

Avoid external DBs; use a JSON file for basic data storage (project info, member IDs, etc.).

Make sure modals, buttons, and embeds use Discord’s latest Interaction API.

Add proper error handling (e.g., if user already has an existing project or no mod role found).

Deliverables:

Complete working code (main file index.js).

Setup instructions for environment variables (DISCORD_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, MOD_ROLE_ID).

Include setup for slash command /add-teammate.

Ensure all embed messages and interactions are clean, mobile-friendly, and aesthetic.

💡 Final Behavior:

Members apply → get verified → get a private space → manage teammates.

Mods control approvals.

Bot handles automation and AI-powered organization.
