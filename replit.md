# Discord Intro Manager Bot

## Overview
This Discord bot, built for the AI Learners India community, aims to streamline member onboarding, facilitate collaboration, and enhance meeting productivity. Its core capabilities include AI-powered member introductions, a system for launching and managing team projects, an AI-driven VC summarizer and meeting assistant, and an AI-powered teammate matching feature. The project's ambition is to foster a more organized, collaborative, and AI-augmented community experience.

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development, where features are developed and integrated in stages. Before making major changes or architectural decisions, please ask for my approval. I appreciate clear, concise explanations and prefer working with modular and well-documented code. Please do not make changes to the existing file structure without prior discussion.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Dynamic Embeds:** Utilizes Discord embeds with dynamic, color-coded designs based on AI-detected skill levels (Green for Beginner, Yellow for Intermediate, Red for Expert) for introductions, and project types for team launches.
- **Emoji Integration:** Uses relevant emojis (e.g., üè´, üìà, üü¢, üü°, üî¥) to enhance readability and visual cues in embeds.
- **Clean Layout:** Focuses on a clean and organized presentation of information within Discord messages, including user avatars and clear footers.

### Technical Implementations
- **Modular Design:** The bot is built with a modular architecture, separating concerns into `commands`, `handlers`, and `utils` directories for maintainability and future scalability.
- **Persistent Storage:** Uses JSON files (`profiles.json`, `projectData.json`, `vcSessions.json`) for persistent storage of user profiles, project data, and voice session information.
- **AI-Powered Processing:** Integrates Google Gemini AI for natural language understanding, text generation, and audio transcription, enabling features like semantic intro analysis, meeting summarization, and teammate matching.
- **Voice Capabilities:** Leverages `@discordjs/voice` and related packages for robust voice channel interaction, including recording and transcription.
- **PDF Generation:** Employs `pdfkit` for generating professional PDF meeting minutes.
- **Error Handling:** Includes comprehensive error handling mechanisms to provide helpful feedback to users and ensure graceful fallback when external services (like Gemini API) are unavailable.
- **Automated Actions:** Implements features like auto-deletion of intro messages to maintain channel cleanliness and scheduled project cleanup.
